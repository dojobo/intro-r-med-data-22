"Intro to R for Data Analysis and Visualization" will be a four-session training series in June and July 2022, given for the MD PhD Program. No prior experience with R or RStudio is expected, nor with statistical software or computer programming. (Users will able to leverage their conceptual familiarity with Excel, for example, to great effect.)

Out-of-class work will be provided and is strongly encouraged but not mandatory. Those who complete the out-of-class work (max. \~3 hours weekly) will receive a certificate of course completion.

Sessions will take place in-person in Scaife 1101.

Session dates:

-   Tuesday, 6/14, 8:30--10am
-   Tuesday, 6/21, 8:30--10am
-   Tuesday, 6/28, 8:30--10am
-   Tuesday, 7/5, 8:30--10am

## Course goals

Using simple but realistic examples, we will learn to:

1.  orient ourselves within the RStudio environment and with the syntax and general concepts of R
2.  import, view, manipulate, and export data in R
3.  perform basic analysis of tabular data
4.  create visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and box-and-whisker plots
5.  create documents which intermix narrative hypertext, code, and plots for ease of communicating your research in a reproducible way.

## Content outline

Prior to Session 1, participants will need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop). Class files will be sent to registrants in advance of each session.

1.  Session 1, 6/14: RStudio orientation and R basics
    1.  What are R and RStudio? What can you do with them?
    2.  Packages: what they are and installing them
    3.  Common data structures in R (data frames, vectors, lists)
    4.  Objects and functions
    5.  Importing spreadsheets (XLSX, CSV) as R data frames
2.  Session 2, 6/21: Data wrangling
    1.  Selecting columns; filtering and sorting rows
    2.  Creating new columns
    3.  Grouping and summarizing
    4.  Random sampling of rows
    5.  Data cleaning: tidy data, missing values
    6.  Exporting data from R
3.  Session 3, 6/28: Data visualization and narration
    1.  ggplot2 and the grammar of graphics
    2.  Geoms (different kinds of plots) and aesthetic mappings
    3.  Applying more layers: additional geoms, scales, themes, labels
    4.  Using RStudio for writing papers, presentations, etc. (RNotebooks and Quarto Documents)
4.  Session 4, 7/5: Statistical tests, modeling, and how to keep learning
    1.  Some common statistical tests (e.g., T-tests, Shapiro, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, etc.)
    2.  Linear regression (and maybe more, TBD)
    3.  Finding and using packages
    4.  Resources to continue your learning and get help
